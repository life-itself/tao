It means to live, work, practice, and create together. It is both a way to concretely practice our values and vision <em>and</em> it is a material exemplar of this vision – i.e. a demonstration that we can live more wisely an well. Coliving is a path to strengthening our community and transforming ourselves and our society through the fostering of a shared culture. It helps us maintain and live our values and transmit them in our daily life. It is a way to demonstrate that a different path is possible.</p> <h2 id="what-is-our-interest-in-co-living"><a href="#what-is-our-interest-in-co-living" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is our interest in co-living?</h2> <p>Coliving is part of Life Itself’s mission because it is a vessel and reification of our big vision.</p> <p>We believe that co-living is essential for sustaining our community both philosophically and materially. Living / working with people with whom we share vision, values and mission nourishes our humanity and stimulates our creativity. Connection to the meaning of life and to other human beings is a deep good. Although there are challenges in co-living with others, we believe that it is also how we develop the most as human beings as it will often require us to overcome our ego and fears. Our vision of co-living will also involve profound commitment to something bigger than ourselves and fostering courage, love, trust and vulnerability as part of this commitment.</p> <p>Finally, co-living allows for economies of scale. As a co-living community, we can create shared spaces that breathe beauty and wellness, and create a lifestyle that otherwise would often be unaffordable.</p> <h2 id="what-have-we-done-to-address-this-situation"><a href="#what-have-we-done-to-address-this-situation" class="header-anchor">#</a> What have we done to address this situation?</h2> <p>Coliving at Life Itself is developed using three complementary models:</p> <ul><li><strong>Co-ownership and Co-op</strong> – for permanent communities where Life Itself is the primary creator and developer of the space</li> <li><strong>Residency</strong> – where community members (and others) stay in spaces on a shorter-term basis (e.g. 2 days to 1 year)</li> <li><strong>Co-governance</strong> – for permanent communities at locations where Life Itself is living alongside and as part of an existing community in an existing space</li></ul> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u8tIdBM.png" alt="Imgur"></p> <h4 id="fig-1-communities-as-lakes-and-streams"><a href="#fig-1-communities-as-lakes-and-streams" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fig 1: Communities as Lakes and Streams.</h4> <p>Permanent Hubs (“Lakes”) are connected, expanded, and enriched by Residency “Streams”.</p> <p>The motivation behind the co-ownership and co-governance model is to provide a more permanent sense of home, security and agency to residents, owners and investors so that the Life Itself community can flourish both philosophically and materially.</p> <p>The motivation behind the residency model is to allow community members to travel, to have access to urban and rural nodes, and to stay in places that are not their permanent address while feeling a sense of home.</p> <p>To use the metaphor of a river and a lake, we want a lake to allow for stability and growth but we also want a river passing through the lake so that the community does not become insular, and is continuously being revitalised and energised.</p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2RZQ3cC.jpg" alt="Imgur"></p> <h2 id="fig-2-co-ownership-co-op-model"><a href="#fig-2-co-ownership-co-op-model" class="header-anchor">#</a> Fig 2: Co-ownership + Co-op model</h2> <h1 id="co-ownership-and-co-ops"><a href="#co-ownership-and-co-ops" class="header-anchor">#</a> Co-ownership and Co-ops</h1> <p>Below is a fuller description of a co-living &amp; investment model.

Owners of capital organize through an “Ltd” and residents through “Co-op”.</li> <li>The Ltd will legally own the space and the residential community will have long-term certainty of tenure via long-term leases.</li> <li>Residents can purchase shares in the Ltd if they wish.</li> <li>Shareholders in the Ltd may buy and sell shares at approx market prices.</li> <li>In overall value terms (not just money), rent should track market rents. In other words, less than market rates in dollar terms can be sustained through time invested in the community.</li></ol> <p>These features support the overall intentions:</p> <ol><li><p><strong>To live in community with social and economic security</strong></p> <ul><li>But without this leading to stagnation and dependence and unnecessary loss of flexibility<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.

We want “people to be free more than comfortable” (“people to be attracted by freedom rather than comfort”) as maximizing comfort can lead to stagnation.

Over these spaces, Life Itself and its members will decide over who uses it and how, subject to consultation and veto by the Godefroy family.</li> <li>Life Itself members who live permanently in the community are consulted first when the existing community are making decisions or investments involving:
<ul><li>A new resident coming to live in the existing community</li> <li>A new space available in the existing community</li> <li>A plan to renovate an existing space (eg: how to design the rooms for the new wedding room so it can also be used by Life Itself during the low season and so that the rooms can be potentially repurposed in the long term for other use of the community).</li></ul></li> <li>Life Itself would also like the ability to rent spaces that are not used/not yet renovated and to be able to invest in these spaces, meaning that there would be a preferential/ deducted rent over a defined period of time. Of course, the existing community will have a say and veto over how the space is designed and done and what type of activity will take place.</li> <li>[New]: Life Itself would have the right of first refusal should the existing community wish to sell.</li></ul> <p>In exchange, Life Itself will commit to deep collaboration with the existing owners and community, for example:</p> <ul><li>Life Itself member residents will learn and contribute to maintaining the shared gardens which are a center of the existing community culture</li> <li>Life Itself members and residents will contribute to cleaning of the shared spaces it uses</li> <li>Life Itself members and residents  will  bring life and activities to the space</li> <li>Life Itself will create a regular monthly meeting with the owners/community to discuss mutual interests and concerns.</li></ul> <h1 id="appendix-community-space-property-features"><a href="#appendix-community-space-property-features" class="header-anchor">#</a> Appendix: Community space property features</h1> <p>Relevant for both Co-governance and the Co-ownership model</p> <table><tr><td><strong>Item</strong></td> <td><strong>Starter-kit</strong></td> <td><strong>MVP</strong></td> <td><strong>Longer-term</strong></td></tr> <tr><td>Communal Kitchen

We can also provide a kind of “rent insurance” [3 items: security of tenure; long-term certainty on rent level (rent control); ability to pass this to kids; transferable rents]</strong></li> <li>Can community members transfer their membership (and rental agreement) to children (or others)?  <strong>Yes to their children but not to others [and even for children subject to children agreement with community guidelines and subject to veto by community, if veto children will receive a form of compensation that will not jeopardize the future of the community.</strong></li> <li>How do community members have a sense of “home” and a sense of security and freedom?  <strong>Community members have security within coop (after a certain period) and coop has long-term security of tenure (coop can’t be can kicked out of the space). Rent control exists qv.</strong></li> <li>How do investors get their money out / sell shares?  <strong>Price capped of average market rate for the area over the last 3-5 years. 1st offer to community members; 2nd to other shareholders; 3rd to anyone.</strong></li> <li>Can the LTD sell the space?  <strong>Only if the Community members agree OR the Community members (Coop) is in default for more than X time (2y)</strong></li> <li>What happens if some community members stop paying rent?<br> <strong>Those people leave the coop [also require deposit] unless other community members cover their rent [via Coop]. The Coop can set a rental insurance for its members in addition to rent.</strong></li> <li>What happens if the Coop fails to pay rent?  <strong>Coop can be mandated to leave property if:</strong> <ul><li><strong>More than 60% of rent is overdue by 5 months</strong></li> <li><strong>More than 75% of rent is overdue by 1 year</strong></li> <li><strong>More than 90% of rent is overdue by 2 years</strong></li></ul></li> <li>Who pays for utilities and day to day upkeep?  <strong>The Coop (i.e. community members)</strong></li> <li>Who can decide about changes in the space e.g. painting the walls?  <strong>Community decides.</strong></li> <li>Who pays for major repairs?  <strong>The LTD (by default) but may be similar to major capital improvements at some point.</strong></li> <li>Who pays and decides on major capital improvements (e.g. a swimming pool) or new buildings?  <strong>The community can decide [by consensus] but investment happens through the LTD and the LTD shareholders have a veto with majority of shareholders [default is that it is ok] (?)</strong></li> <li>Do we have to have a coop?  <strong>No, esp if small number of residents, then could have a direct relationship with LTD.</strong></li> <li>Can community members also be shareholders in the LTD?  <strong>Yes, absolutely.
