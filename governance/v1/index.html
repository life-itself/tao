So far, it has functioned with the loosely defined governance structure natural to an emergent initiative. However, with the ongoing growth of Art Earth Tech as a community and enterprise it behoves us to put in place solid foundations for our future development as well as provide transparency. Our motivating question is: what are the governance structures, patterns and practices we should put in place that would support and provide clarity on:</p> <ul><li>A sense of ownership, fairness and trust amongst the nucleus, its members, and the broader community.</li> <li>People investing their time, energy and goodwill in the vision, mission and values of AET to be recognised.</li> <li>Preserve and enhance AET’s reputation.</li> <li>Staying true to the deepest elements of its vision, mission, values and culture, whilst being able to evolve in line with circumstance.</li> <li>Being able to live on beyond its founders and a balance between creating a vibrant and dynamic community with members being able to be more autonomous</li> <li>Clear reciprocal relationships with associated projects ( eg: London Hub, LEAP, Datopian, Institute, etc]</li></ul> <h2 id="our-hypothesis"><a href="#our-hypothesis" class="header-anchor">#</a> Our Hypothesis</h2> <p>We propose to address these intentions by:</p> <ul><li>Creating an explicit membership model</li> <li>Establishing a board</li> <li>Creating separate voting and revenue shares with a formula for assessing contribution and allocating  new [revenue] shares based on contribution</li> <li>Setting out clear community agreements</li> <li>Creating template agreements for associated initiatives and spaces and test these out with the London Hub and at least two projects e.g. the LEAP and Datopian</li></ul> <h1 id="membership"><a href="#membership" class="header-anchor">#</a> Membership</h1> <p>Our intention is to create membership structure which reflects the vision of AET – where people experience being supported, cared for, and believed in while living the AET vision and mission  through our values of joy, open mindedness, rigour, primacy of being, authenticity and getting stuff done.</p> <p>The other intention of the model is to reflect and recognise the different level of involvement and contribution to AET by its members.</p> <h2 id="how-do-you-become-a-member-of-the-community-and-how-does-it-work"><a href="#how-do-you-become-a-member-of-the-community-and-how-does-it-work" class="header-anchor">#</a> How do you become a member of the community and how does it work?</h2> <p>You become a member of AET by being an active member of a “family”. A “family” is a group  that meets regularly for mutual support, sharing and exchange rooted in AET values and practices and oriented towards AET’s mission.</p> <p>A “family” size is usually between 5 to 8 people and meet a least once a month (preferably once every two weeks)  in person or by phone/video.  Each “family” has a family elder (which can alternate every 3 months) who is responsible for coordinating the group meeting and be a communication point between the members and the rest of AET.</p> <h3 id="faq-about-the-family"><a href="#faq-about-the-family" class="header-anchor">#</a> FAQ about the family</h3> <p><strong>How does a member leave?</strong></p> <p>By ceasing to be actively involved in a family eg: not attending meeting for more than 3 months.</p> <p><strong>Do I get to choose my family?</strong></p> <p>A suggestion of which family to join can be made. Families are not meant to represent existing networks of friends within the AET community, the families will be chosen to provide a balance of personality, AET experience, and age and the ability to make new AET friends.</p> <p><strong>How can a member be removed?</strong></p> <p>A member can be removed by the Board at their discretion (though obviously endeavour to discuss, complete etc).</p> <p><strong>What are the qualification to be an AET member?</strong></p> <p>To have attended a Gathering or two sprints.</p> <p><strong>What happens if many members of my “family” have left?</strong></p> <p>If your “family” is smaller than 4 members then you will be merge with another family.</p> <h2 id="levels-of-involvement"><a href="#levels-of-involvement" class="header-anchor">#</a> Levels of involvement</h2> <p>While you are a member of a AET “family” group, each member might have different level of involvement with AET. Therefore within a family you may find people with various levels. Below is a drawing and explanation of the different criterias for each level:</p> <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gfjFICq.png" alt="Imgur"></p> <p><strong>Level 1 Supporters</strong></p> <p>You are part of a family and make a financial and/or in-kind contribution (e.g. regular donation of €10 a month or help run a supper or other small community event.)</p> <p><strong>Level 2 Contributor</strong></p> <p>L1 + you represent AET, have been a family elder, and have attended at least one Gathering and have actively contributed to one major initiative.</p> <p><strong>Level 3: Shareholder</strong></p> <p>L2 + you have and are leading a major event (30 people +)  or an initiative and shown long-term competence and commitment to AET’s mission and vision. You attend all quarterly team meetings and trainings and are engaged in ongoing self-development work.</p> <h2 id="membership-agreement"><a href="#membership-agreement" class="header-anchor">#</a> Membership agreement</h2> <p>As a member, you agree to the following as part of being part of the community:</p> <ul><li>To live according to the values of AET of joy, rigour, open mindedness, authenticity, generosity, primacy of being and getting stuff done.</li> <li>Not to gossip about other members of the community.</li> <li>To take collective responsibility for the care and wellbeing of the “family” as a whole and it’s individuals.</li> <li>To be aligned and supportive of the vision and mission of AET.</li> <li>Not to withhold communications or intentionally cause upsets.</li> <li>If you have any issue or problem with AET, you will responsibly communicate only to the person who can resolve that issue.</li> <li>You agree to have a minimum of 1 group phone call a month with your family and when possible to meet in person.</li></ul> <h3 id="communicating-resolving-conflicts"><a href="#communicating-resolving-conflicts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Communicating &amp; Resolving Conflicts</h3> <ul><li>“Getting complete”, emotional “cleaning” and conflict resolution is a priority in our community.</li> <li>We believe that unspoken resentment and unresolved disagreements cause blocked relationships that damage the community.</li> <li>We seek to create safe spaces for each other and to learn tools such as meditation, integrity (restoration), flower watering (acknowledgement), non-violent communication and sharing to help us transform conflict into positive growth.</li> <li>We are determined to show-up to each other, not hide from things for convenience, when we have a chance to address issues in a sufficiently safe and kind space.</li></ul> <h1 id="shares-revenue-and-voting"><a href="#shares-revenue-and-voting" class="header-anchor">#</a> Shares, Revenue and Voting</h1> <h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" class="header-anchor">#</a> Introduction</h2> <p>AET is a for-profit company and it may grow in the future by incorporating non-profit arms. The core AET entity will probably operate more like a CIC  (community interest company) than a traditional for-profit company though the exact legal structure is to be worked out. Specifically, classic CIC principles:</p> <ul><li>Asset lock: the assets held by AET can not be liquidated and distributed except to another entity pursuing the same purpose and mission.</li> <li>Distribution to shareholders will be set at a low level, sufficient only to attract necessary capital (for example, repayment of initial investment plus X% a year)</li></ul> <h2 id="principles"><a href="#principles" class="header-anchor">#</a> Principles</h2> <p>AET in it’s governance stand on three principles:</p> <ol><li>Recognition of value</li> <li>Recognition of risk</li> <li>Fair but not equal</li></ol> <h3 id="recognition-of-value"><a href="#recognition-of-value" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recognition of value</h3> <p>We believe that there are many more values than monetary ones.

Art/Earth/Tech as I see it does two totally valuable but actually rather distinct things:</em></p> <p><em>1. Art/Earth/Tech ASSOCIATES</em></p> <p><em>The for-profit arm with paid projects, investments and enterprises. It makes sense for this to be a select group of trusted people who actively want to work with each other. The top-down board structure you’ve suggested is appropriate for this type of organisation.</em></p> <p><em>2. Art/Earth/Tech NETWORK</em></p> <p><em>The not-for-profit arm. A community of people. It would be great if this was a more democratic organisation so that members feel equal to one another. A member-led organisation would have a greater sense of ownership and fairness, and encourage more commitment and input from members. One way to do this would be for each family to elect their own facilitators (1 or 2 people), and that the board of the AET Network to be made up of the family facilitators. The AET Network would then be responsible for organising Gatherings, Springs, Family groups and peer-to-peer support on a not-for-profit basis.</em></p> <p><em>Basically, I think what AET is doing is totally wonderful, but that the current structure conflates two quite distinct functions. I think that separating off the network as a more democratic service space where things are freely and generously given will attract lots more energy into the organisation, make it more sustainable and give it opportunities for great growth and to attract different types of funding. It will also mean that business arm can be a more simplified, streamlined organisation that can be justifiably exclusive.</em></p> <p><em>If the two types of organisations are mixed together, there’s a risk of the lower levels of membership feeling disaffected and unmotivated. They could put in lots of voluntary work into an organisation that essentially the Level 3 founding members forever have control and ownership of.</em></p> <p>This is a longer point and one we have now had the chance to discuss more in person 😃</p> <p>Regarding the specific item here I think our concern was that one are balancing two risks (and two benefits)</p> <ol><li><p>That org “goes bad” (some set of people exploit others) or that risk of that puts off participation</p></li> <li><p>That org gets bogged own in horizontardism or gets hijacked by a clique and that or risk of that puts off participation.</p></li></ol> <p>At present, we feel the set up we have balances these and also reflects fact that (based on our own experience) item 2 is a greater medium-term risk than item 1. We also think that the best way to guard against either of these is through our culture and being - no formal rules will be sufficient.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/life-itself/tao/edit/master/governance/v1/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit this page</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
